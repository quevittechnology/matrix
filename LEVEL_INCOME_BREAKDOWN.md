## 💎 Earning Potential by Position

### If You're a Qualified Upline

**Scenario:** You're Level 13 with 2+ directs, and you have 100 people in your matrix downline.

**Potential Monthly Income:**

Assuming each person upgrades 1 level per month on average:

```
100 downline × 1 upgrade × avg 2 BNB = 200 BNB/month
```

**But remember the 150% ROI cap!**

If your total deposit is 27.0336 BNB:
- Maximum earnings: 40.5504 BNB
- After that: No more level income (capped)

### If You're the Root User

**No ROI cap + Fallback payments:**

```
Same 100 downline scenario:
├─ Direct level income: 200 BNB/month
├─ Fallback payments (30% unqualified): +60 BNB/month
└─ Total: 260 BNB/month (UNLIMITED)
```
